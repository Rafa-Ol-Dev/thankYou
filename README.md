# Portfolio - Thank you

This project is a simple HTML redirect page that displays a "Thank you" message. It serves as a complement to my personal portfolio website, [rafaeloliveira.github.io](https://rafaeloliveira.github.io).

After clicking a form button, users will be redirected to this page. After a few seconds, they will be automatically redirected to the homepage of the original project.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Font Awesome

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it! The page will open in your browser, and you will see the "Thank you" message with a redirect notice.

## Customization

If you want to customize the page further, you can modify the CSS styles in the `obrigado.css` file. Feel free to adjust the colors, fonts, or layout to match your preferences.
